## s7ProSimLib Siemens S7 PLCSim

This DLL comes from another of my repositories, which was compiled 5 to 6 years ago maybe more. I got smart and added all information on github otherwise it would have been gone for good.

On that repo there is the manual for that library from Siemens, and some documentation how I got it to work with Unity3d back then, it is worth mentioning that this only works with x86 32bit Unity3D only. In the same repo there is a sample csharp script.
